        description:
            "Developed a fully automated and reproducible ATAC-seq analysis pipeline using Nextflow DSL2 to identify chromatin accessibility differences between leukemic (K562) and healthy (GM12878) human cell lines. The workflow includes quality control, adapter trimming, alignment (Bowtie2), peak calling (MACS2), differential accessibility analysis (DESeq2), gene annotation, and functional enrichment. Results are visualized with volcano plots, heatmaps, PCA, and pathway enrichment charts, highlighting key genes and pathways involved in leukemogenesis.",

Conducted performance benchmarking on datasets up to 50 million elements with varying distributions (random, sorted, reversed, skewed). Demonstrated the strengths and limitations of histogram-based load balancing compared to dynamic and static partitioning methods.",
