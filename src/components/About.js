          I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Kansas with a strong foundation in full-stack development. 
          Before diving into grad school, I worked as a Software Engineer for over 2.5 years where I built scalable, responsive web 
          applications using Angular, TypeScript, and modern UI practices.
          <br /><br />
          Over the years, I've developed a knack for turning complex requirements into clean, usable interfaces. Whether it's integrating APIs, 
          improving component reusability, or helping students learn Python code as a GTA, I enjoy both writing great code and making an impact.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of class and code, I love to paint and listen to music. I thrive in environments that mix structure with creativity, 
          and Iâ€™m always up for learning something new.
